    "The idea is to take two different data sets, and perform a cross-match of objects between the two.\n",

    "Perfect cross-match\n",
    "--------\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a perfect cross-match, we have $a \\in A$ matches with $b \\in B$ if $a = b$. \n",

    "Cross-match with uncertainty\n",
    "--------\n",
    "\n",
    "Say now A and B have some uncertainty in the position of their objects, and their cross-match is subject to a definition of neighbourhood, or minimum \"distance\" between them (keep in mind, we are in the 3 dimensional space!).\n",
    "Depending on how we define the neighbourhood (that is which metric to compare two objects a priori close but not identical), the objects matching can be very different.\n",

    "**Using the distance to centers: **\n",
    "Let's suppose our metric is the (euclidean) distance between the centers of objects, and two points are said identical if their distance is smaller than $\\epsilon$. We have $||AB|| < \\epsilon$ and $||CD|| > \\epsilon$, therefore we would say that A matches with B, but C does not match with D.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using the angular separation: **\n",
    "Let's suppose our metric is the angular separation between the centers of objects (at same radius), and two points are said identical if their angular separation is smaller than $\\beta_c$ . Both points have the same angular separation $\\beta < \\beta_c$, therefore we would say that A matches with B, and C matches with D.\n",
    "\n",

    "Number of matched pairs\n",

    "Let A and B be two finite sets of points $\\{ (r, \\theta, \\phi) \\}$ with $r \\in U(0, \\infty), \\, \\theta \\in U(0, \\pi), \\, \\phi \\in U(0, 2\\pi)$, and $U(x, y)$ is the uniform distribution over [x, y].\n",
    "Let denote $x$ the cross-match between points according to the distance to centers, and $o$ the cross-match between points according to the angular separation. We have \n",
    "\n",

    "\\text{card}(AoB)(r) &\\propto cste\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",

    "Of course this scaling depends on how we sample the parameters and fill the space. Instead for example, we could have sampled $\\cos(\\theta)$ from $U(-1, 1)$, and the results would have changed. But all of that is to illustrate the fact that the scaling of the cardinal for the cross-match depends upon the metric chosen.\n",
