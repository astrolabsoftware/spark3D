  /**
    * This routine returns the ClassTag of an object.
    * The primary goal is to have a way to pass the ClassTag of a Scala object
    * to the python world.
    *
    * By default in py4j, if you try to call from Python a Scala method/class/etc
    * with Reflection (generic arguments using ClassTag), you will run
    * into trouble unless you manually specify the ClassTag of generic arguments.
    * Let's take an example:
    *
    * // Definition in Scala
    * def method1(in: A) = ...
    * def method2[A : ClassTag](in: A) = ...
    *
    * # From python
    * method1(in) # works
    * method2(in) # fails
    *
    * The reason is that the python constructor for a Scala method with generics
    * needs to know the type of A:
    * method2(in, ClassTagFor_in) # work
    *
    * @param obj : (Any)
    *   Any object for which you want to know the ClassTag
    * @return (ClassTag[_]) the ClassTag of the object
    *
